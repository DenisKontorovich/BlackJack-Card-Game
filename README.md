# BlackJack-Card-Game

Blackjack card game where the whole point of the game is to get a card score of 21 or lower 
 and have a higher score than the opposing player(the dealer). The player and dealer are given 2 cards to begin
 with and the player can decide whether they want to get another card and increase there total or stand and allow
 for the dealer to go, if the player hits and their total goes over 21 then they bust. The player can only 
 initially see the dealers first card, the dealer gets an automated turn where the dealer continuosly hits until 
 their total is equal or greater than 17. At this point the game is considered over and the winner is calculated.
 The user starts with a certain amount of money and can place bets on the game if they have enough in their wallet.
 Note: If a card has a number on it then it's value is the number on the card, however if the card is a jack, king, or queen
 the value of the card is 10. For aces the value can either be 1 or 11, if the card being valued at 11 will cause either
 the hand to go over 21 then the value of the ace will be 1.
